# Promotional Strategies with Sales by Category View

Knowing which categories are the most popular can help in designing targeted promotional strategies. Using the Sales by Category chart, you can define types of products with high daily consumption rates.

From this chart, you see that beverages are consumed at a rate of 500,000 items per month. This indicates a strong customer preference for these items. Less popular items like condiments have a lower consumption rate of 212,000 items per month.

The shop can run promotions on beverages and dairy products to attract more customers. Conversely, they can create bundle offers that include less popular items like condiments to boost their sales.

## Product Placement
The shop can optimize the layout by placing high-demand items like beverages and dairy products in easily accessible areas. This can enhance the shopping experience and potentially increase sales. Less popular items can be placed in areas where they might catch the eye of customers who are already shopping for their favorite products.

## Financial Planning
By understanding which categories drive the most sales, management can make more informed financial decisions. They can allocate budget more effectively, investing in high-performing categories while managing costs in lower-performing ones.
