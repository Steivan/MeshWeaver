By using or choosing such Microsoft Azure Region and running the Project in that region, you give your consent to the processing of Customer Content in the that specific region including any applicable terms and restrictions given by Microsoft. If the Customer uses Personal Data in Projects on the Mesh Weaver Service in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Customer is in addition obliged to select for such Projects only data centers (as provided according to the MS Azure Regions) located within the European Union or Switzerland, which are available for selection for the Mesh Weaver Service. Systemorph disclaims any liability and responsibility if the Customer uses Personal Data on the Mesh Weaver Service in violation of the above terms and conditions.

## Prices and Payment
Customer shall pay fees on a per-Project basis as agreed according to the chosen Mesh Weaver Project Plan for the given Project and this Agreement (“Mesh Weaver Project Plan Fees”), see Systemorph Plans.

The fees are charged in advance as valid for the Mesh Weaver Project Plan applicable. If a recurring payment for an Mesh Weaver Project Plan Fee is not paid, Systemorph may set the corresponding Project to edit-only mode, such that execution of code is no longer possible.

Systemorph reserves the right to adjust the Mesh Weaver Project Plan Fees anytime during the Agreement for the future provisioning of the Mesh Weaver Service. Systemorph may in particular adjust its Mesh Weaver Project Plan Fees for executing code on the underlying Azure infrastructure if the Microsoft Azure fees for the corresponding infrastructure are changed by Microsoft. Any adjustment of the Mesh Weaver Project Plan Fees shall be made in accordance with the change procedure pursuant to Section 5.3 above.

The Customer’s obligation applies regardless of whether a license to the software being part of the Mesh Weaver and any Customer Project on the Mesh Weaver delivered by Systemorph (i) has been obtained by Systemorph to the effect that the Customer derives its limited right from Systemorph or (ii) has been obtained directly by the Customer.

If the Customer uses third party software inside a Customer Project, Systemorph will not be liable for the functionality of such software or its use in relation to the Mesh Weaver.

Systemorph may immediately suspend all or part of Customer’s use of the Mesh Weaver Service, if (a) Systemorph reasonably believes Customer’s use of the Mesh Weaver could adversely impact the Mesh Weaver, other customer’s use of the Mesh Weaver or the underlying sub-contractors used to provide the Mesh Weaver; (b) there is suspected unauthorized third-party access to the Mesh Weaver; (c) Systemorph reasonably believes that immediate suspension is required to comply with any applicable law and regulations; or (d) Customer is in breach of the restrictions in Section 7.3.

Any termination by the Customer must be made directly via the corresponding functionality in the Mesh Weaver. Systemorph will notify the Customer of any termination via email.

### Effect of Termination.
Upon the termination date of the Agreement, all the Customer’s rights under this Agreement immediately terminate. In particular the Customer’s access to the Mesh Weaver Service and Projects shall cease, and the Customer’s right to use the Mesh Weaver Service and Projects will end.

The Customer remains responsible for all fees and charges incurred through the termination date. Any fees and charges already invoiced to and/or paid by Customer in advance shall be non-refundable.

Systemorph shall remove all Account Data and Technical Information of Customer from its systems as per the termination date, unless the applicable mandatory law prohibits deletion. Before the Agreement terminates, Customer should either terminate all its Projects or make its Projects available and administered by another Mesh Weaver Customer as provided by the corresponding features of the Mesh Weaver Service and update the billing information so that another Customer is responsible for paying the incurring Mesh Weaver Project Plan fees. Should the Customer not make use of these options before the termination of the Agreement, Systemorph is allowed to also delete all Customer Content from the corresponding Mesh Weaver Service Projects within 24 hours after termination of the Agreement, unless the applicable mandatory law prohibits deletion.

### Termination of Projects.
Projects may be deleted in the Mesh Weaver on request by the Mesh Weaver Customers.
Projects may also be initiated for deletion by Systemorph upon failure of payment.
If the Project is terminated or requested for deletion, Mesh Weaver Project Plan fees and other charges paid by Customer in advance shall be non-refundable.
Systemorph will remove all Customer Content from the Mesh Weaver Service corresponding to the deleted Project within 24 hours after Project deletion was initiated unless the applicable mandatory law prohibits deletion. Customer may export and retrieve its Customer Content in a standard procedure as provided by the Mesh Weaver Service prior to the deletion date; export and retrieval are subject to technical limitations and prerequisites as documented in the Mesh Weaver Service.

## Final Provisions
Systemorph shall act at all times as an independent entity. Nothing in the Agreement shall be deemed to create or constitute a partnership, agency relationship or joint venture between the parties.

Customer may set off claims of Systemorph against its own claims only if such claims have been expressly acknowledged by Systemorph or finally adjudicated by a competent court.

Neither party shall be liable for any loss suffered by the other party or deemed to be in default for any delays or failures in performance hereunder (other than in relation to payment) resulting from acts or causes beyond its reasonable control including, without limitation, strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes (whether involving the workforce of Systemorph or any of its sub-contractors or any other party), failure of a utility service or transport or telecommunications network, act of God, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, compliance with any law or governmental order, rule, regulation or direction, accident, breakdown of plant or machinery, fire, flood, storm or default of suppliers or sub-contractors, provided that the affected party notifies the other party of such an event and its expected duration.

These GTC (including any Annexes current) shall govern exclusively the rights and obligations between Systemorph and Customer in respect of the Mesh Weaver provided to the Customer. There shall be no oral agreements.

Should any provision of the Agreement be or become void, ineffective or unenforceable in full or in part, the validity and enforceability of all the remaining provisions shall not be affected. The void, ineffective or unenforceable provision shall be regarded as replaced by the effective and enforceable provision that corresponds as closely as possible to the economic objective of the void, ineffective and unenforceable provision.

The exclusive court of jurisdiction shall be the ordinary courts in Zürich-1, Switzerland.
