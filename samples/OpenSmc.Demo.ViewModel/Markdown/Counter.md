# Counter Button Example

This section describes an example involving a button and a ViewModel state that counts button clicks. The counter button in this project likely increments a counter each time it is clicked, and this state is managed by a ViewModel. The ViewModel is responsible for holding and updating the count value, and the button's click event triggers the increment action.

To create a counter button in a project, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. **Create the ViewModel**: This will hold the state of the counter.
2. **Create the Button**: This will trigger the increment action.
3. **Bind the Button to the ViewModel**: Ensure that clicking the button updates the counter in the ViewModel.

Here is a detailed example using a simple MVVM pattern in a WPF application (C#):

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Create the ViewModel:

### Create the View (XAML):
- Define a button and bind its command to the ViewModel's command.
- Display the counter value.

### Bind the View to the ViewModel:
- Set the DataContext of the View to an instance of the ViewModel.
